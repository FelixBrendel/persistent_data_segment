#+TITLE: Persistent Data Segment
* Overview
 - Project template for a 64bit Windows executable
 - Without C standard library (using only Windows functions)
 - Therefore small executable size (4 kb)
 - Across runs of the program, the contents of the variable =persistent_data=
   are preserved in the executable
 - The executable can be renamed or moved between runs without losing the data
 - The struct =Peristent_Data= can easily be extended by adding new members

* Limitations
 - The =Peristent_Data= struct should have a size >= 8 bytes
 - Data can only be written back if no other instance of the program is running
 - If the program is being renamed or moved while it is running, the changes of
   the =persistent_data= in this run will not be preserved (the executable will
   contain the last saved version in this case)
